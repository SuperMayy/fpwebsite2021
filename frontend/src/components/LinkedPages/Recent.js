            <p>The World Health Organisation warned the world to prepare for a second wave of coronavirus. 
                Earlier this year, while lockdown may have been lifted in Nigeria, however shops were only open three times a week. 
                As the virus has yet to be eliminated, daily income earners had to make such demanding choices. 
                Market vendors, hairdressers and taxi drivers and so much more were severely impacted.

            <p>One of the largest populations of Africa, workers are faced with a tough choice: earning money to feed their families, 
                being susceptible of being infected or suffer starvation when isolating at home. Nigerian workers receive no compensation 
                pay for their days off and food prices have surged, leaving them with a severe lack of provisions.
