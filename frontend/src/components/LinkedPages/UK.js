            <p>One of the universitiesâ€™ largest cultural societies, the organisation strives to educate 
                and empower students of African and Caribbean background and heritage. 
                This is implemented through debate sessions, film nights, book club sessions and more. 
                In March of this year, Ms Igwe did a first aid workshop for two hours, in collaboration with the ACS. 
                The society aligns well with FP as both organisations firmly believe in the educational empowerment of 
                the Afro-Caribbean diaspora.</p><br/><br/>
